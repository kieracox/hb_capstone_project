# Talently

Talently is a fullstack web application that acts as a professional networking site that connects recruiters with jobseekers. The app allows users to create a profile based on their interests as a jobseeker, or the role they're hiring for as a recruiter. Then, jobseekers can search for roles and connect directly with the recruiter for that role, while recruiters can search for candidates to fill the roles they're hiring for.

## Technologies Used
Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Javascript, React, AJAX, HTML, CSS, Cloudinary API

(Dependencies are listed in requirements.txt)

## Key Features

- **Profile page:** Jobseekers can input information about themselves and the type of roles they're looking for, while recruiters enter in basic personal info as well as information on the role(s) they're hiring for. There is no limit to the amount of roles a recruiter can have. 

Jobseekers can upload a resume via the Cloudinary API, while recruiters can upload a job description for each role they're hiring for. A url to these documents will populate in the search result associated with each user.

- **Search function:**: Jobseekers can use a variety of parameters to search for roles that they're interested in, while recruiters can search for candidates that may be a good fit to fill their roles. The search is generated by querying the SQL database using SQLAlchemy query chaining. The results are displayed on a new page, rendered using React components. Both users can save a search by entering in a nickname and clicking the save button, which adds a saved search to the database with a relationship to the user.

- **Connection requests:** If a jobseeker sees a role in their search results they find interesting, they can send a request to connect with the recruiter for that role. Similarly, a recruiter can send a connect request to a jobseeker they think matches the role they're hiring for. The request is handled using an AJAX request so the page doesn't refresh and reload the results. If a user accepts a request they receive, they will see that user displayed in their list of connections on their dashboard. The manage connections page shows contact details and other info for that user, and they can also remove a connection there.
